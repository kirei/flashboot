Introduction
------------

This is a small infrastructure to build minimal OpenBSD installations
suitable for booting of flash and USB devices. This is derived from the
scripts and tools used to build the OpenBSD installation media.

The system builds a ram disk kernel (bsd.gz) with a reasonably
complete set of daemons and utilities. This file should be installed
into the root directory of the boot device. Note that this
infrastructure only builds the kernel image, it is beyond its scope to
install it onto the flash device, or to prepare the flash device for
booting the kernel. If you are playing with this stuff, you should know
how to do this anyway.

When the flashboot kernel boots, it will attempt to mount the flash
device as /flash and extract any tarball files matching /flash/*.tgz
into the root directory. This mechanism is intended to include
the system configuration that the host will use, though it may
be used to deploy updated or new binaries too. The configuration
parameters accepted include most of the standard OpenBSD /etc/ files,
including /etc/hostname.* and a useful subset of /etc/rc.conf. See the
initial-conf/rc script for details. As well as extracting /flash/*.tgz,
the init script will copy any files under the /flash/conf/ directory to
the root too - I find this a little more convenient for small config
files that frequently change (e.g. pf.conf).

In the absence of a tarball or directory-based config, the system is 
configured with a basic initial configuration. The first Ethernet 
interface is brought up as 192.168.0.1 and the console is available 
(login: "root" password: "password").  The intention is to make it 
easy to load a real config from a freshly imaged flash card.

The assumed platform is a Soekris NET4501 (www.soekris.com), but
is very easily changed by selecting a different kernel config and
adjusting or renaming the initial-conf/hostname.sis0 file.

Installation
------------

To install flashboot onto your media, you will need to format it and make
it bootable first. Read the fine boot(8) and installboot(8) man pages for
instructions on how to prepare the media.

Once the media is setup as bootable, you can just copy the kernel image
to /bsd on the mounted device. You should also create a /conf directory to
store your custom configuration - files under here are copied into the 
ramdisk at system boot time. After startup the boot device is mounted as 
/flash in the root of the ramdisk, so you can make changes at runtime there.

To influence the boot loader, you can create a /etc/boot.conf file on the 
root of the bootable media (*not* /conf/etc/boot.conf). You can use the 
standard boot.conf(5) options, such as changing console device and speed here.

Building
--------

(if the following sounds too hard, please use the binary distribution
of flashboot, available from the website)

A built release of OpenBSD is required for this infrastructure to
work.  To save space, you will probably want to turn off compile-time
options such as Kerberos support. The current version of flashboot 
requires that you have built the entire system as dynamically linked,
i.e. set STATIC= in mk.conf. Previous flashboot versions used crunchgen,
but fully-dynamic saves 1.5Mb.

Here are the basic steps you need to take.

1. Read and understand "man release" 
2. Build a release (using build-release.sh)
3. Build a kernel (using build-kernel.sh)
4. Install obj/bsd.gz to the root of the boot device as bsd
5. Ensure that installboot has been run on the boot media

First, make sure all building scripts has the execute bit set for
you and all other (chmod ugo+x build-*).

Next, edit release.sh and change SHORTREL and LONGREL to
match the version you want to build. You should also change
URLBASE to match a mirror near you. 

build-release will download, patch and build userland automatically

This build can take a very long time. Make sure you run this in the 
flashboot-directory and with sudo since the script needs to be able
to mount devices.

    # sudo ./build-release.sh

When the building is done you should have a fully dynamic release in
sandbox. Now it's time to make your kernel. The
build-kernel.sh takes a kernel-config as a parameter. Currently
COMMELL-LE564, GENERIC-RD, NTFS, SOEKRIS4501, SOEKRIS4521,
SOEKRIS4801, SOEKRIS5501 and WRAP12 configs are provided. You can
easily make your own by copying one of the existing. 
    
    # sudo ./build-kernel.sh WRAP12

The kernel is then stored under the obj/ directory. The use of
a gzipped kernel is preferred. The bootloader automatically extracts
it during boot. It saves space on the flash and transfer time during
upgrade.


Customisation
-------------

The system support customisation in three different ways.

1. Any file that you add to the root of the flash-card (/flash) that 
has the tgz-extension is automatically extracted to the ramdisk 
during boot. This is useful for small extensions or configuration 
that you can distribute in a single tgz-package. Files can also be 
added to the /flash/conf directory, they are then automatically 
copied (not extracted) to the ramdisk during boot.

2. There is also an option in rc.conf to create a second ramdisk in 
/usr/local. By default this is not done at all to save memory on the 
device. If activated this will also extract any files located in 
/flash/pkg/ ending with the tgz-extension to /usr/local. This 
provides an excellent way to add packages directly from the OpenBSD 
ftp-server without needing to expand the original ramdisk. The 
rc-script will even remove some unnecessary files from the packages 
such as man-pages and files needed only for compiling.

3. Recompile a kernel that suits your needs and that includes or 
excludes the binaries and libs that you need for your application. 
Change the list to include extra files. 
If you have decided to go down this road you 
might just as well modify the default configuration located under 
the initial-conf directory.

The easiest way to add configuration is to add files and folders
to initial-conf and add list.custom in Flashboot root folder
where instructions to the build script for each file is provided.
Look at the included list file to get correct syntax.

The first two alternatives can be done without having to recompile 
the distribution and should be sufficient for most needs.

Kernel sizes are a problem when piggybacking a ramdisk blob. 
Kernel+ram disks larger than 16MB needs to increase the NKPTP in the 
kernel config. This is already done for all the kernels and you 
shouldn't have to do anything as long as you stay under 32MB. The 
second problem is that kernels larger than about 14MB will use up 
all the ISA DMA memory, for this reason ISA DMA is disabled. This 
leads to the final problem: if isadma is disabled, then things that 
attempt to use it (e.g. floppy disk access) will panic the kernel. 
In the end the best solution is to try to keep your kernels small.

This infrastructure does a couple of things to save space, but is 
not at all ferocious as I stopped tweaking once I reached my target 
(bsd.gz < 5Mb). To save space, only a couple of term{cap,info} 
entries are transferred (see TERMTYPES in the Makefile).


Creating bootable cd
--------------------

To create an iso image suitable for booting and running flashboot
on a x86 PC, first read the build instructions above. Step 1 and 2 
must be successful and in step 3 use the build-livecd.sh script with 
the GENERIC-RD kernel config.

    # sudo ./build-livecd.sh GENERIC-RD

The build-live_cd.sh script will create the directory live_cd before
creating the image. Everything in this directory will be included on the
cd. The files cdbr, cdboot etc/boot.conf is required for booting. To
customize the cd with additional data, create the directory live_cd
under the sandbox directory  in advance and populate with data and 
modify rc.{init|more} as needed.

The build-livecd.sh will use the default flashboot config files 
and make modifications prior to ramdisk creation. Any customisation to 
ramdisk setup should be done by editing build-livecd.sh.

If everything worked then you should find a new iso image in 
obj/live_cd{version}.iso. Without any customisation the iso is roughly 
21MB in size. Finally... burn the iso with your favourite cd burning 
program.


Support and bug reporting
-------------------------

Please send bug reports to djm@mindrot.org or subscribe to the 
mailing list flashboot@mindrot.org. I don't have time to support this 
software, so if you run into problems you are on your own. This code 
works very well for me, so hopefully it will for you too.
